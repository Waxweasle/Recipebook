# Recipebook
A program that connects to the Edamam API and pulls recipes that fit the user specified requirements. A GUI created with tkinter allows users to fill in necessary info and displays various recipes in an easy to read format.
## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.0+
## Edamam API set up
1. Create an account at https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api
2. Go to Account>Applications>Create New Application> and enter your parameters to get your application id and application keys.
3. Paste this information into `app_id =` and `app_key =` within the get_recipes() method
## How to
1. Simply run the program and enter the necessary information as prompted by the GUI. 
2. All fields **NOT** marked optional must be filled in to contact the API. ![Cover image](https://github.com/Waxweasle/Recipebook/blob/main/cover.png)


3. After searching , results from the Edamam API will be displayed "book style" with "next" and "previous" buttons that allow the user to flick through recipes page by page. The API provides a link to the reipce method which is clickable from the recipe page.![Cover image](https://github.com/Waxweasle/Recipebook/blob/main/page.png)
4. If you wish to edit any of the search parameters that are fed into the API, full documentation can be found at https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api. 
## Future improvements
1. Implementing a "save favorites" feature that saves the users favorite recipes to their machine for quick and easy retrieval.
2. A web scraper to pull the method of the recipe from the origin website(currently not provided by the API) so the user doesn't need to open a link to the page.
